- material files

  The material files are looked for in the current directory, or in
  the directory pointer to by the environment variable G4NKDATA. The
  files contain the refractive index in the standard X-ray notation
  where n = (1-d) - i*k. The material files contain three entries per
  line: energy(eV) d k.

  See G4XrayRefractionIndex.cc for some more details.

- enabling the process G4XrayGrazingAngleScattering

  This is done in the standard Geant4 manner. The process must be
  applied to the gamma particle.

  Enabling the process is not enough: the relevant volume boundaries
  must be coverd with a skin or border surface of type
  G4XraySurfaceProperty. There is one example surface:
  G4XraySpecularReflectingSurface. This is a surface that reflects
  X-rays in a specular manner, with a reflectivity that depends on the
  angle of incidence.
